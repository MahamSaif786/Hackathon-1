# Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Specification

## Feature Description
This module implements a comprehensive Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics education. Students will learn to build autonomous humanoid systems that can understand natural language commands through speech recognition, process them using large language models for cognitive planning, and execute actions using ROS 2. The module integrates voice recognition (using Whisper), LLM-based planning, and multi-modal perception to create complete voice-to-action robotic systems.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Journey
1. Student accesses the VLA module content and begins with Chapter 1
2. Learns to implement speech recognition using Whisper to convert voice commands to text
3. Develops cognitive planning systems using LLMs to interpret commands and create action plans
4. Translates language commands into ROS 2 actions for robotic execution
5. Integrates multi-modal perception for environment awareness and object manipulation
6. Completes the capstone project building an autonomous humanoid that responds to voice commands

### Edge Cases
- Voice commands with background noise or low audio quality
- Ambiguous or complex language commands requiring clarification
- Robot encountering unexpected obstacles during action execution
- Multi-modal perception failures in challenging lighting conditions
- LLM-generated plans that are unsafe or impossible to execute

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for speech recognition accuracy and response time
- Integration tests for voice-to-action pipeline functionality
- Simulation tests for robot action execution in various scenarios
- Performance benchmarks for system response latency
- Validation of safety constraints during action execution

3. The system must execute ROS 2 actions based on interpreted commands
4. The system must integrate visual perception to understand the environment
5. The system must handle ambiguous commands by requesting clarification
6. The system must implement safety checks before executing actions
7. The system must provide feedback on command interpretation and execution status

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system must respond to voice commands within 3 seconds
2. The system must maintain 99% uptime during active operation
3. The system must handle concurrent users during educational sessions
